# Presentation Repo

This is my repository for presentations related to the [Photoshop API](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/photoshop-api-docs/). In the [decks](/decks/) folder, you'll find the various presentations (usually named in such a way as to make sense, for example, the 'short' folder is a short form presentation), and within [demos](/demos), you'll find, guess what, demos. These demos won't be able to run without proper credentials of course.

## History

* 8/8/2023: I had been fleshing out `decks/short` and realized I was making it... not short. So I copied `short` to `main`. I will probably remove stuff from `short` in the future.
